# PortfolioA
Webapp demo project using Java EE and HTML-CSS-JavaScript
The project is "a customer order processing system with multiple order items" development.

Motivation
I wanted to build working Webapps(SPA) for my implementation experience.
With the project, I also tried to show my ability/expertise about (not only web) programming.

Build Status
The system is working as is but also is a partial implementation.
"Recent Orders" of a customer part is not developed. (will be added sooner or later)
Shipping management including shipment tracking interface is not developed.
Collection management including back office system interface is not developed.
Code management system (customers, items, employees) is not developed. (data is built through MySQL wWrkbench)

Code style
Microservices architecture (without using MVC framework like Spring)
